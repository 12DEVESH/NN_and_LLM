# NN_and_LLM

Welcome everyone to the Neural Networks and Large Language Models course. This course wass designed to introduce us to the concepts of Neural Networks (NN), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM). It was a 4-week course, with each week covering one topic and the final week focusing on the applicational part.
 

A week-wise distribution of the course was as follows:

Week 1: Introduction to Neural Networks
 
·       Basics of neural networks and their components
·       Activation functions and gradient descent
·       Backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks
 
Week 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Fundamentals
 
·       Introduction to NLP and its applications
·       Preprocessing techniques for text data
·       Word embeddings and distributed representations
·       Sentiment analysis and text classification using neural networks
 
Week 3: Introduction to Large Language Models
 
·       Understanding the concept of language modelling
·       Exploring traditional language models (e.g., n-grams)
·       Introduction to Transformer architecture
 
Week 4: Advanced Applications and Model Fine-tuning
 
·       Advanced NLP tasks: text generation, machine translation, question answering
·       Fine-tuning large language models for specific tasks
·       Handling limitations and biases in language models
·       Ethics and considerations in deploying large language models

I have uploaded the relevant assignments and final project , based on the above schedule
